My Projects:

  * "Multi-modal Emotion Recognition with Graph Neural Networks"
  Applied a novel hierarchical multi-modal feature fusion to the graph level. Used attention-based encoder with Graph Convolutional Networks. Trained using Valence-Arousal learning pipeline. Achieved new state-of-the-art results in the following data: IEMOCAP, MELD, AVEC. Library used: NetworkX, Pytorch Geometric. Supervised and granted funding from Prof. Hiroshi Ishiguro.
  
  * ["Joint Fovea and Optic Disc Segmentation for Degenerated Retina"](http://bionicvisionlab.org/authors/tang_shuyun/)
  Proposed a new U-Net based attention model with multiple local bottleneck structures. Conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies to prove it in segmenting the landmarks in disease fundus images(Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Glaucoma), which are usually hard to segment with traditional methods. Achieved new state-of-the-art results in the following data: REFUGEE, Baidu ADMD, Messidor.

  * ["Joint Modeling of EEG, fMRI and Structural MRI"](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu/people/tang-0)
  Combined high temporal resolution EEG and high spacial resolution fMRI for better brain activity modeling. Used spatial-temporal graph neural networks with adaptive adjacency matrix to solve the time series prediction. Interpreted the signal source localization among various brain tasks.
  
  * ["Kaggle Competitions"](https://github.com/44Shu/Kaggle-Solutions)
  I achieved top 530/150000 and Competition Expert tier in Kaggle by the end of 2020. This is the project repo for my competitions (4 silver medals and 2 solo bronze medal).

  * ["SSH Port 22 Hacker Passwords Pattern"](https://github.com/44Shu/ssh-readme)
  This project determines the password’s security by comparing its patterns within the dataset using the K-means clustering process to sort out 8 clusters and finding out their corresponded central passwords(the medoids). We present our results in a visualized distance comparison to the 8 medoids through the use of Damerau–Levenshtein distance and Hamming Distance.
  
  
  
## Professional Yoyo player: 2019 World Yoyo Contest 1A 8th, 2019 Las Vegas Open Champion, FL state champion 

  Just like the musician love composing, I love expressing my feeling via the yoyo. You can [check my freestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJy80GyWog&t=1s).
  I am currently sponsored by:
