My Projects:
  * ["SSH Port 22 Hacker Passwords Pattern"](https://github.com/44Shu/ssh-readme)
  This project determines the password’s security by comparing its patterns within the dataset using the K-means clustering process to sort out 8 clusters and finding out their corresponded central passwords(the medoids). We present our results in a visualized distance comparison to the 8 medoids through the use of Damerau–Levenshtein distance and Hamming Distance.
