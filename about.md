My Projects:

  I achieved top 900/150000 and Competition Expert tier in Kaggle by the end of 2020. This is the project repo for my competitions (4 silver medals and 1 solo bronze medal).

  * ["SSH Port 22 Hacker Passwords Pattern"](https://github.com/44Shu/ssh-readme)
  This project determines the password’s security by comparing its patterns within the dataset using the K-means clustering process to sort out 8 clusters and finding out their corresponded central passwords(the medoids). We present our results in a visualized distance comparison to the 8 medoids through the use of Damerau–Levenshtein distance and Hamming Distance.
  
  * ["E-Commerce Data Analysis"](https://github.com/44Shu/E-Commerce-Data-Analysis)
  The primary goal of our project is to explore differenct influencing factors (namely product price, delivery length, payment method, quantity of product photos, and the geographic position of customers) on customer's e-purshace bahaviors and satisfaction, so that we could predict customers' purchase preference and the trend of ecommerce
